WRH owns 26 multifamily properties in the southeastern United States and Texas. Here is summary:


```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
x<-summarise(mg,count=n(),units=sum(units),revenue=sum(rev))
arrange(x,units=desc)
print(format(x,big.mark=","))
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(units~st,data=mg)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
